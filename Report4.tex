\section{Introduction}
Globally, lung cancer remains the top cause of cancer deaths. Low-dose CT screening for at-risk populations has begun in the United States, with other nations anticipated to adopt this practice shortly. However, analyzing the vast number of CT scans generated by such screening programs places significant strain on radiologists. This has sparked considerable interest in creating computational tools to enhance screening efficiency.

Identifying pulmonary nodules—which could indicate early-stage cancer—is a crucial initial step when examining lung cancer screening CT images. Numerous Computer-Aided Detection systems have been developed for this purpose. The LUNA16 challenge aims to conduct a comprehensive assessment of automated nodule detection methods using the LIDC/IDRI dataset.

The LIDC/IDRI dataset, which includes nodule annotations from four radiologists, is freely accessible to researchers. This makes LUNA16 a fully transparent challenge. Participants can submit either complete nodule detection systems or algorithms that evaluate pre-identified candidate locations. By providing a list of potential nodule sites, the challenge accommodates teams developing methods that assess the probability of a nodule existing at specific locations within CT scans.
